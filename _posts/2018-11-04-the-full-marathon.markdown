It was a dream come true when I was able to finally achieve running a full Marathon and that too running the boroughs of New York. Fewer things in life will be as close as to this one. There are lot of things that running had helped me learn and this full Marathon was a true testament to it - persevarance, humbleness, hardwork, pain, happiness, gratitude and the list goes on. Its not just the race itself, but entire preparation through out 2018 was an amazing journey. Key was always been - "Train your mind, body will follow". Thanks to everyone who helped keep me motivated through out the journey esp my wife who was cheering for me on the streets on different boroughs carrying the placards - couldn't have done it without her! <3
