One of the best things that has ever happened to me in the past eight and half years in the united states (at the time of this writing)
is new york city!

I always keep hearing nyc is a love-hate relationship. "I hate that I love New York!". But let me tell you, it was always a love-love relationship with nyc for me!
Probably the second best since [chennai] :-)

I will continue to take you thru new york as I see it! Here is one for a starter:
