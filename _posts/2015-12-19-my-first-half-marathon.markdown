Running has continued to be the passion, the happy state, the panacea for every downturn in life.
Running continues to give hope, keeps humble, and teaches everything in life is achieved by 
practice. Jen A. Miller summarizes the feeling towards [running] beautifully :)  

Had a chance to do something special this year - raise money and awareness for Leukemia & Lymphoma cure! 
A very big thanks to all my friends who joined me to help and support this cause - We all made a difference! 
Thanks to [TNT] for helping me train as well as giving an opportunity to serve the needed!
